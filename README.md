# Building a Smart Mailbox
A projct as part of the 'Embedded Sensing Systems' course at the university of St.Gallen in Spring 2025. 

____
### Questions to answer before Presentation

[ ] What is the timeframe of the Presentation? 
[ ] Are we required to bring Slides?
[ ] What can we do, to make the presentation more exicting ? 

## Overview

## System Design 
- Main Objectives
  ( => Originaly we said, that our main objective was connectivity : However please check in code (give it to gpt) to ask, what 'objective' we can guarantee (e.g. good battery life or precise measurements etc..) Just find something and report it)
- Design Decisions
    - Battery 
    - Networking
    - Sensors 
    - (Compute)
- Trade-Offs


## System build
- Hardware components
- Software components
    * Edge Computations
    * Backend-Server 
    * Dashboard & Notifications
- Construction Manual
    * 


## System Evaluation
- What Targets (hard-requirements) have we reached ?
- What precission, connectivity, feeatures does our system allow ?
- Outlook: What are future extensions based on our 'extendable Design' =


## TL;DR
- System Design
- System Build 
- System Evaluation
